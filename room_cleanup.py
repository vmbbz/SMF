"""Periodic room cleanup — detects expired Redis rooms and cleans up server resources.

When a Redis room key expires via TTL, the server-side resources (game loops,
signaling sessions) linger in memory. This module runs a periodic sweep that
cross-references in-memory rooms against Redis and cleans up orphans.

Also sends ``room_expired`` messages to connected WebSocket clients so they
can close WebRTC connections gracefully.
